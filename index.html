                <h3>And this also might come with the end of some of my activities</h3>

                <h3>Also known as backdoors, server-side exploits were quite popular at some point</h3>
                <h3>And I also was in this community, creating payloads and remotes</h3>
                <h3>Making visual payloads was fun, and I probably will still create some.</h3>
                <h3>I also make similar stuff in VRChat with screen-space shaders</h3>
                <br/>
                <h3>The real problem here was the exploiting:</h3>
                <h3>Inserting malicious code that servers would run to send what I want from a remote</h3>
                <h3>Which is also why I won't use my VRChat avatars in public instances.</h3>
                <h3>This was really bad, in a lot of ways.</h3>
                <br/>

                <h3>And everywhere I could: official servers, custom gamemodes, HvH (Hack V.S. Hack), Anarchy, etc...</h3>

                <h3>But I at least want to leave a trace of it.</h3>
                <h3>I will of couse continue to play HvH, Anarchy, and probably still cheat in normal modes</h3>
